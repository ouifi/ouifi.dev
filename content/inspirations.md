# Intro

Everyone has teachers which influence them on their educational journey. Sometimes the teachers may never know the direct influence they had on an individual. This is especially true for online content creation. I will most likely never meet you, my dear reader[^1], and I have also not yet had the fortune to meet any of the creators listed here. For some creators, I may only list their name. In this case, I have frequented their corpus enough to find any and all of it useful.
