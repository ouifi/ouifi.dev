# Intro

WOW! My own website! That is kind of crazy. I am reaching out over the vast geographical distance between us, covering perhaps thousands of miles to communicate these silly ideas with you. 

# Projects

- [ouifi.dev](https://ouifi.dev): This very website! A blog and place to present myself to the greater cyber space.
- [Guess/r/](https://guessr.io): One of my portfolio projects. A guessing game (pre-dating Wordle!) using React+Fastify. Hosted on Cloudflare Pages (frontend) and Heroku (API).
